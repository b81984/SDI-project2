    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>My theme is following the ongoing XCOM: Enemy Unknown campaign I'm playing, in which my squad is lead by Corporal Jax (who has recieved a promotion since we last saw him!).  Today, the troops go into a hot zone where aliens have been abducting citizens.  The specifics of the scenario today include whether or not the squad stands and fights, or chickens out and heads back to the skyranger.  It also counts up their ammo used, and notifies an unlucky soldier's family that he's given his life bravely in defense of Earth.  </p>
